# comment-box

This project is based on implementation of form in HTML using CSS and JavaScript. This project includes form validation and error messages on the form.

---

## summary

In this project we simulate form submission to an imaginary database. Here we have a form with two input HTML elements **Name, Email and Textarea** for comment section.

When you fill out the form including all the fields and click the submit button, your **name and comment** response will be recorded and the result will be displayed below the form element.

It's important to **note** that if any of the form input is not filled it'll will trigger a validation red border and a warming note **Fields cannot be empty** and the form will not submit.
